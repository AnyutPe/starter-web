Komitas's "Gusan" choir in 1910
"Seeking to bring appreciation of Armenian music to a wider audience",[20] Komitas moved to Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), the Ottoman imperial capital in 1910.[13] "There he trained a group of students in Armenian melody and formed a choir that toured Armenian communities and gave performances of the folk compositions that Komitas had arranged for four-part choir."[20] He founded the Gusan choir (Hay gusan since 1912), made up of tens of musicians.[13] With the aim to produce professional musicians, he taught musicology to Barsegh Kanachyan, Mihran Tumacan, Vagharshak Srvandztian and others.[13]
